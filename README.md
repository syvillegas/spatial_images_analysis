# Studying the urban nature and children’s recreation areas around primary schools in Barcelona


In this project, we will be constructing some spatial computations, through the use of the rasterio and geopandas modules from Python, and end up with the best sub-divisions of Barcelona, in terms of their vegetation index and a measure between the schools and children’s recreation areas of the neighborhood, since both the surroundings and the spaces within schools can have an impact on chil- dren in many different levels. Then, we will be also adding data regarding the real estate market in Barcelona per each sub-district, so that we can compare the housing prices with the results we obtained; since schools in Barcelona take into account the proximity of each family’s house to the school itself, we will try to extract some conclusions on whether it is a privilege, or not, to have more desirable school surroundings that do not have a negative effect on children’s academic performance. 

The data source from which we have obtained all our files is the Barcelona’s City Hall Open Data Service (***https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en***).
